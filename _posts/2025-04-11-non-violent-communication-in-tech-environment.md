Tech is often seen as a logical, fast-paced world built on code, deadlines, and efficiency. But beneath the surface of systems and sprints, there’s one thing that keeps everything running smoothly: **communication**. And more importantly, the kind of communication we foster.

In an industry where cross-functional teams, tight timelines, and high expectations are the norm, it’s easy for tensions to rise and for communication to become reactive rather than thoughtful. That’s where **Non-Violent Communication (NVC)** comes in—a powerful framework that can help individuals and teams collaborate more effectively, with greater empathy, and less friction.

## What is Non-Violent Communication (NVC)?

Developed by psychologist Marshall Rosenberg, NVC is a communication approach based on empathy, honesty, and mutual respect. Despite the name, “non-violence” doesn’t refer to physical harm, but rather to avoiding subtle forms of aggression in how we speak and relate to one another—blame, criticism, passive-aggressiveness, or dismissiveness.

NVC revolves around four simple but powerful components:

1. **Observation** – Describe what’s happening, without judgment or evaluation.  
2. **Feelings** – Share how the situation makes you feel.  
3. **Needs** – Identify the underlying need or value connected to those feelings.  
4. **Request** – Make a clear, actionable request to address the need.

The goal is not to "win" a conversation or avoid conflict entirely, but to understand each other better and find solutions that meet everyone’s needs.

## Why Does NVC Matter in Tech?

Tech environments can be intense. Whether you're reviewing someone’s code, giving product feedback, or navigating the challenges of a remote team, the way we communicate has a direct impact on morale, collaboration, and productivity.

### Practical Examples

- **Code Reviews**  
  Instead of:  
  > *“This code is a mess, it’s hard to follow.”*  
  Try:  
  > *“I found it difficult to follow the logic in this function, and I’m wondering if you’d be open to breaking it into smaller parts?”*

- **Team Stand-Ups**  
  Instead of:  
  > *“You’re always late with your tasks.”*  
  Try:  
  > *“I noticed your last couple of tasks slipped past the deadline. I’m feeling a bit concerned because we rely on everyone’s updates to plan the next sprint effectively.”*

- **Feedback Culture**  
  Rather than avoiding difficult conversations, NVC encourages giving feedback in a way that invites dialogue, not defensiveness.

### Key Benefits

- Fosters **psychological safety**, making people more likely to contribute ideas or ask for help.
- Reduces misunderstandings, especially in diverse or remote teams where tone and context can easily be lost.
- Encourages a **learning-focused culture** rather than a blame-driven one.
- Helps handle conflict productively without damaging relationships.

## How I Try to Bring NVC Into My Work

As someone who transitioned into tech from a teaching background, I’ve always valued how communication can shape an environment—for better or worse. In my current role, I’ve been actively working to create a more empathetic, understanding workspace by sharing what I’ve learned about NVC.

One initiative I’m especially proud of was delivering a **knowledge-sharing session** to my colleagues. It wasn’t just a theoretical overview—we discussed real scenarios from our day-to-day work and how we could reframe our language using the NVC model. The goal was to normalize talking about feelings and needs at work, not in a forced or overly emotional way, but in a human one.

We explored:

- How to give feedback without triggering defensiveness
- How to express frustration or disagreement respectfully
- How to listen more actively, even under time pressure

What surprised me was how open people were to these ideas. Some colleagues even started using NVC-style check-ins during meetings or code reviews. It’s still a work in progress (as all culture-building is), but it feels like a step in the right direction.

## Final Thoughts

You don’t have to be a “people person” to practice Non-Violent Communication—you just have to be willing to pause and consider the impact of your words. In a field that’s often driven by logic and speed, NVC is a reminder that empathy is not a distraction from the work—it’s what allows us to do our best work, together.

Whether you're a junior dev or a team lead, trying out NVC practices can lead to more trust, less stress, and a stronger sense of shared purpose. And in the long run, that’s just as valuable as any technical skill.
